Semantic commit is a good practice that seeks to instruct how to create well-formed commits messages.\
This facilitates the analysis of the project log by another team member or by automated tools.

Each commit must be atomic. As one of the foundations of continuous integration (CI), this methodology provides that each new functionality or change is always available and properly documented, with this, errors can be detected in advance.\
The commit message must be in the present imperative. This tells someone what the commit application will do, instead of what you did.
